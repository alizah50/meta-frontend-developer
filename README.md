# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, serving as the final milestone of the Front-End Development track.

The website demonstrates the implementation of a booking application for the Little Lemon platform. It was built using React components, highlighting the ability to utilize React for website development, and incorporates API calls.

Note: Aside from the design, the only fully functional feature of the website is the "Reserve a Table" function.
